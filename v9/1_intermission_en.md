#Intermission Deep Night Discussion

The night before festival meeting was ended, 00:00 o'clock at night.

The unplanned emergency meeting was held.

"Sorry, I have to make all of you come here at this hour. I know some of you are tired but please bear with me a bit."

I said that and then looked to all people who come here.

"Shuna, you were life-saver. Not only your cooking was really delicious, even you were able to convince Midley that Milim herself having hard time to deal with, thanks, really."

I thanked and told her I really grateful, Shuna just smiling sweetly.

"It's not like that, It was successful because Yoshida-san cooperation. Also, Rimuru-sama really praised Hakurou's sashimi so it's somehow make me vexing a bit."

Sashimi cooking that involved of cutting and rolling fishes, Hakurou was indeed better than Shuna in this case. This even could be said a special skill so it's not a matter lack of effort from Shuna ……… even so Shuna still vexing she couldn't do better.

With that said, she still honestly received my thanks.

After that, I addressed Myourmiles whose been concentrating with works behind the scenes.

"Myourmiles-kun, how about merchants side? Is there any problem happened?"

In preparation to be displayed at the festival, we added influx of various goods from various countries.

People who managed it were Rigurd and Lilina-san. I gave task to Myourmiles to handle every merchant that coming here.

"Merchants' opinions are great. After they see this majestic view of this country, all of them were surprised. The event last evening, all of them ate various delicacies. Peasants from neighborhood countries coming here too, so we can say it was great success. Many goods are in good quality, we can hope to continue good commerce relation with them ―――"

Myourmiles then glanced to Rigurd. Rigurd nodded and took over the explanation.

"Yes. It's just like Myourmiles-dono mentioned, many new goods like vegetables, fruits, smoked-meat and smoked-fish, and also many arts collected. There are also people who transporting living livestock here, we can say that the preparation for the festival is perfect."

Rigurd approved it by saying that there's no need to worry about goods deficiency.

"Ingredients for tomorrow banquet is readily imported too."

Lilina-san nodded with what Rigurd said and added that.

"So there will be no problem indeed."

"Yes, I think so too. But ――― nah, it will be fine."

Hm? Myourmiles somehow wanted to say something but then he revised his thought and not saying a thing. This kind of things really made me curious so I just hope he really just said it.

"Hey, come on, I told you not to hold back right? If you stopped in half-way, it makes me more curious you know."

I said that and encouraged him to talk.

Even Benimaru and Souei somehow agreed with me and just nodded without saying a thing.

Because of that pressure, Myourmiles scratched his head and opened his mouth.

"Maybe it's just me overthinking, but many merchants that made several transactions for goods displayed in window shop are someone that I never know before. I'm confidence that I have good memory to remember people, I just think about this more. So I investigated about them a bit ―――"

He thought something but then there wasn't any problem happened.

From shop owners that he knew, he heard that lot of them were new commerce partners. But those owners never heard anything bad about them. They provided good quality goods with low prices, so he was laughed because worrying this too much.

Myourmiles tried to interact to several of them, and their behavior was good.

"Maybe it's because I'm just tasked with important jobs, it makes me in high strung probably."

Myourmiles said that while making bitter smile.

Recently, jobs that Myourmiles had to undertake were enormous. So I worried whether he had been fine and so I wanted to hear something from him.

"Hey really, are you okay? Are you doing the impossible and overworked……?"

But Myourmiles denied my worrying with a laugh.

"Hahaha, please don't worry. Leaving this aside, I have more important topic!  At fighting tournament tomorrow, the champ Masayuki is going to participate!! This has become rumor to entire city, many bars are having bets for this."

Myourmiles passionately ensured that he didn't overworked. Moreover, he brought the topic which decided yesterday afternoon about Masayuki's participation.

"That's right. I want to hear opinions from you all about this so that's why I have you to come here now."

Rimuru told everyone about what happened before when he came to see Masayuki and his group, and the reaction when they heard that it for the first time. Benimaru looked at Souei and asked for detail with "What's with that guy?".

The one who answered wasn't Souei but Shion.

"Those are annoying rude bunch! They told something kooky like subjugating Rimuru-sama. I wanted to bury them all but ………"

"I stopped her. There were many people out there, also if Shion went berserk there, it would definitely affect the festival tomorrow."

Oh I see, no wonder why Shion didn't go berserk back then.

I thought she  become calmer but it seemed I still couldn't take it easy. Thankfully Souei was there too.

"I'm glad you stopped her. There was my friend Yuuki too over there, if  rumor says that I picked a fight against a champion in front of the city gate it would became widespread, it would  only added unneeded cautions for people."

I said that with a sigh and Benimaru nodded.

"It's indeed like that. Shion, be more prudent okay?"

"Ha, you don't have to tell me. I'm just disgruntled a bit, never really wanted to make a scene there. But ―――"

"Kufufufu, I understand what Shion-dono wanted to say. You just can't stand still while master being ridiculed right? If Benimaru-dono was there, you would have that reaction too."

"――― That won't happen. I'm always calm."

Benimaru said that with doubt, let his sight going everywhere.

Right, he's unreliable too.

"So Rimuru-sama. The discussion that you want to hold is how to finish that whatever champ? If you give that job to me, I will make him disappear without trace this night."

"I don't intend like that. Don't hastily move based on assumption, okay?"

So I pressed to make sure everyone there understood.

After changing the mood, I told the discussion topic.

"What I wanted to discuss is, which executives that is going to participate in the fighting tournament tomorrow."

As I said those words, it had explosive effect ―――

"Oh?"

Benimaru had his eyes glittering.

"I see."

Shion made a fearless smile.

She did something behind my back, but would she be okay?

Maybe she just looked at fighting more, and forgetting what she's doing before.

"Kufufufu, interesting. This is indeed interesting discussion."

And Diablo too, having a deep smile.

"Even I will be seen by people there, I will show that my power will be useful."

Geld too was excited.

Even Souei made "Hn" a light smile, became motivated to participate.

And Hakurou too.

He didn't say anything but he became restless.

Gabiru had his own exhibition so he could only make disappointed expression……….

――― Oh well, their reaction were better that what I expected.

Since Ranga was sleeping in my shadow, so he just didn't react to it.

Also, I'm not going to permit him to participate anyway so it's not problem.

Among executives that going to fight for participation, I coughed to gather their attention.

"I said wait. In the place where other countries spies watching, you don't have to going serious right?"

"Kufufufu. Even without being serious, I will show that I can trample ―――"

"Stop! Hear me, I will say this first. Benimaru, Shion, Diablo, and Souei. You all cannot participate."

"Wha!?"

"What's the meaning ―――"

All of them shocked and asked me for the reason.

"First is Souei, you are ˝secret operative˝<sup name="ref-1">[1](#onmitsu)</sup> right? Fighting in the middle of everyone eyes is out of question."

Souei realized after I said that, since he's convinced so he didn't complain again.

I'm glad he didn't say something selfish like participate by disguising. But I added something just to make sure.

"So I'd like to give an office to you."

"Office?"

"Right. You're going to oversee any intelligent activities within country, and I'll give you official title. You're going to command official army named ˝Darkness˝<sup name="ref-2">[2](#darkness-kurayami)</sup>. I approve Souka and other those your subordinates, but just don't say that to them okay?"

"Understood!! Thank you very much, Rimuru-sama!!"

Souei became impressed more than I thought.

This was actually just an excuse to make him not to participate to the tournament, but if he himself like that, then this is good too.

Souei had several hundreds subordinates. If he went to selectively choose from them who will be Darkness member is okay too.

Souei was good with this, now for the remaining 3.

out of all my subordinates, those 3 were among the strongest.

Saying to them to not participate was the source of problem. I knew this would happen so I already made a countermeasure.

"Hear me okay? I'm currently thinking of an office that will handle important people from west-side countries, officially as ˝Four Divine Kings˝<sup name="ref-3">[3](#four-king)</sup>."

"Four Divine Kings………"

"Oh my―――"

"I see."

The color of eyes all of them changed.

All of them were baited.

"3 of you are exceptionally strong from all my subordinates. So there, the representative is Benimaru, 2 from the rest of 3 people, I want assign both of you, Shion and Diablo."

Among these 3, Benimaru was the fittest to be the leader. After all Benimaru had a role of overseeing army as a general in place of me.

Benimaru was the fittest to be the representative of this mysterious office "Four Divine Kings".

Even though I said like that, this was actually completely just a honorary title. The excuse was to make sure they wouldn't participate to tournament.

"I'm the representative ……… I'm gladly take this title!!"

Good. Benimaru took it.

"I'm not too convinced with Benimaru as the representative, but with my work later on in the future, I will show you to think again. I'm too gladly receive the title of the Four Divine Kings. Rimuru-sama!"

Shion took it too.

"Four Divine Kings, huh? I'm targeting to be number 1 for Rimuru-sama, but I realized that I'm just a new member here. I can't be greedy. Here, I'll strive to be closer to Rimuru-sama even little by little."

Right, would he accept it?

Diablo was really has such handful personality, really.

Anyway, these 3 would named themselves as member of the Four Divine Kings

"I thank you all for accepting it. Okay, I told you all that the 3 of you cannot participate in the tournament, so this Four Divine Kings is the reason."

"And, the meaning?"

"Hm. Actually we need to choose the last member of the Four Divine Kings. I thought that Souei is fit for this, but Souei is a secret operative. He couldn't just easily let himself known, so he's ruled out for this."

I said like that and looked how people reacted, all of them nodded to agree.

"So with that said, I'm going to have the remaining people here to participate, and the winner can call himself as the Four Divine Kings too, how do you all think?"

I barraged them with several questions and arguments, atmosphere within discussion hall became a stance that will react based on others attitude.

But here, I got unexpected line.

"Hm………. I actually wanted to participate, but tomorrow I have a date ――― I meant, I'm promised to guide Momiji around the city ……… but, if it's Rimuru-sama's order ―――"

The person that I wanted to count on, Hakurou, unexpectedly decline to  participate.

A person who had high level skill like Hakurou would be undefeated, but the timing was too bad. He said he would participate if it's an order, but it's not like I can do that.

To measure Masayuki's skill, I thought Hakurou was the fittest for it ――― but to disturb a chance to make a memory with his daughter would only bring a grudge.

"That's important, Hakurou. If you break that promise, Momiji-chan will never talk to you again in her life."

"T-that's………"

I had a senior at my workplace that broke his promise to his daughter and went to work instead, he lamented that his daughter had been ignoring him for an entire week.

Those two finally met together, so what would happen if the promise was broken ……….

"Also, Instead of being Four Divine Kings, Hakurou is better to be Benimaru's army advisor."

Hakurou nodded because he was impressed.

I accepted Hakurou's request to not participate in the tournament.

So people who can participate is ―――

"I have research publication ……… and Geld-dono is stronger than me. In this case I leave it to him."

As expected, it's only Geld alone.

Since Gabiru had his own exhibition, he couldn't participate. As Geld understood this, he accepted Gabiru's entrusted feeling.

"Understood. I will give my all, and will stop Masayuki whatever to win!"

And Geld accepted by nodded strongly.

If it's Geld, strength-wise he's really fit for the title, but for the sake of appearance, Geld being there was kinda ………

I appointed Benimaru to handle these two problematic people, but I felt guilty for Geld too.

Oh well, I would think about it again later. Now it's enough for Geld to measure Masayuki's skill.

When I thought like that.

"I want to introduce a man who is fit for title 0f the Four Divine Kings!"

Suddenly Rigur stood up and said that to me.

In order to handle when something unexpected happened in the tournament, having more participants could be better.

If it's Rigur recommendation who himself had reached A-rank, I thought I could believe it.

"R-right. I don't think we won't have any problem with Geld participating, but this is just in case, so who is it?"

I said that and asked Rigur to elaborate.

"I'm afraid that I cannot participate myself since I have task as handling security, but we have the strongest person after me. He is ―――"

Strongest after Rigur? ――― he meant!?

"Gobuta!!"

Right, just what I thought.

But as if to dispel my worry, Rigurd too nodded strongly.

"If it's Gobuta, he's fit most as our representation."

He said like that.

"Fufu, he can be classified as talented among my disciples. Kinda clever and also has some good technique. He still doesn't develop his basic power, but it's also interesting if we use this tournament as a chance for him to grow more."

Even Hakurou said something like that.

No opposition from executives.

At very least I had to ask whether the person in question has the willingness ……….

"Wosh, wosh"<sup name="Gobuta-what">[4](#Gobuta-what)</sup>

Right.

He himself very motivated, so it's no problem.

I thought no problem, and approved Gobuta's participation in the tournament.

I thought to conclude this discussion, but before I had the chance, there's a voice.

"My king, I think I will participate to that tournament whatever!"

Ranga had awakened and came out from shadow saying that, while swaying his tail.

"Well, it's impossible for you right? This is mainly for martial art after all ………"

"R-right. There's summoners among participant so they can summon beast to fight together with them ……… but even so it's hard for Ranga-dono to participate………"

In the tournament where people competing their skills, Ranga's strength was out of tournament standard.

I disapproved his request, and Myourmiles nodded to agree with me.

Ranga looked at Gobuta resentfully.

Ranga was looked sad but in this matter, I had no choice, I kept my heart strong and rejected his request.

"To accommodate Geld-dono and Gobuta-dono participation, I will prepare seating's. Since the total participants are more than 200 people, I will divide them to 6 arenas and have a battle-royal fight on each arena to pickup people that pass to the final tournament."

Total was more than 200 people, the participants indeed were so many.

With the preliminary battle  tomorrow, it would decided that 8 person who will fight in final tournament.

There wasn't any need to time limit preliminary, so at first it was decided to have 8 division which each division having battle-royal. Since we had two people participate so it's changed to 6 division.

"I have to guide guests from each country tomorrow, so I give the proceeding to Myourmiles. I leave this matter to you!"

"Please don't worry!"

As Myourmiles answered convincingly, I relieved and nodded to him.

"Diablo, you know several journalists right?"

"Yes. I've invited them to attend this international festival, it can be a good ads."

As expected Diablo was well prepared.

Since he's already known so it's useless to hide his power.

But, if the feared daemon worked as a referee ――― so it would give a huge-gap and would make impression on him better even a little.

"Sorry but I'd like you to be the referee. Since champ Masayuki, Geld and Gobuta participate, I don't think hobgoblin is fit to be referee."

"Kufufufu, please leave it to me!"

If anything happened, Diablo would be able to handle it.

"Well then, I'm sorry to take your time. Albeit this is already late, please take a rest for today!"

"""Yes sir!!"""

This time the discussion has ended.

To prepare for events tomorrow, we then slept to rest.
